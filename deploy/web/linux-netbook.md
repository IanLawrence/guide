# Installing on Linux NetBook

## Software Requirements

* 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS Desktop or Server

## Installation Procedure

* Get the RapidFTR Web installer from the [Downloads](https://bit.ly/rapidftr) page. Alternatively use [this direct link](https://bit.ly/rapidftr-server) for the current development version (useful for commandline-installs)
* Extract the downloaded archive
* Start the installation by running:

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Offline Installation

* The RapidFTR installer is able to automatically detect the connectivity status of the netbook and adjust appropriately. Performing an offline installation can therefore be performed in the same way as noted above.

## Hardware Requirements

Following are the minimum hardware requirements:

* 1 Ghz Processor
* 2 GB RAM
* 10 GB Free Disk Space (for RapidFTR + all required software)

# User and Role Administration

When you add new users, enter a new password they can use to log in to RapidFTR. This password is given to the user by verbally or by email. By default, the users are prompted to change the password after they log in for the first time.

When creating a user, you select the role they will perform on the system. Roles are customisable by a system administrator and determine the features the user will be able to view.

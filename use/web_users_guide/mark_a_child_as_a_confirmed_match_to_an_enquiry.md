# Mark a child/enquiry as a "Confirmed Match"

This functionality can be used to either mark a child as a confirmed match to an enquiry or an enquiry a confirmed match to a child. Here we will use an example of a child being marked as a confirmed match, but the same can be applied to the enquiry.

To mark a child record as "Confirmed Match", navigate to the list of matches to the enquiry.

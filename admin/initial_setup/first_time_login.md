# First Time Login

After installation, RapidFTR is ready for configuration. This is accomplished by logging in to the Web GUI as a RapidFTR Administrator and making the necessary changes.

To log in to RapidFTR, open up a browser and type the URL of the RapidFTR instance. For a cloud instance, this may take the form:

`https://<rapidftr-domain>`

For a netbook installation, this may take the form of:

`https://<IP Address of Host>`

Please note that when accessing a RapidFTR instance on a netbook, you may encounter any of the following SSL erros:
* `Your connection is not private` or
* `This connection is not trusted` or
* `This is probably not the site you are looking for`

Please note that on the netbook, this behaviour is expected since RapidFTR on the netbook uses a self-signed certificate. You should therefore go ahead and proceed to access the RapidFTR site.

The default credentials for the RapidFTR Administrator account are:

** *username* **: rapidftr

** *password* **: rapidftr


After logging in for the first time as a RapidFTR Administrator, you should proceed to set up roles, users and forms for your instance.

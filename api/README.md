# RapidFTR Deployment Guide

This guide covers the APIs used to integrate with RapidFTR.

RapidFTR is a mobile (Android) application and database system that lets aid workers collect and share information about children in emergency situations, so they can be reunited with their families. This process, called Family Tracing and Reunification (FTR), has so far been done using paper forms. The RapidFTR project initially came out of an [ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu) class called Design for UNICEF, taught by Clay Shirky.  It is now in active development with help from volunteers from [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com) and the open source community.

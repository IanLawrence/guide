# Installing on Windows NetBook

## Software Requirements
* RapidFTR works on Windows 7 and above
* [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?standalone=1)
* [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com)
* Either Google Chrome or Firefox required since we don't support Internet Explorer

### Installation Procedure

* Get the RapidFTR installer from the [Downloads](https://bit.ly/rapidftr) page
* Start the installation by double clicking the installer

On completion, the installer automatically starts the RapidFTR Server. To access the RapidFTR application, open up a browser and type in the address bar http://localhost

## Hardware Requirements

Following are the minimum hardware requirements:

* 2 Ghz Processor with VT-x support
* 4 GB RAM
* 10 GB Free Disk Space (for RapidFTR + all required software)

### Notes:
RapidFTR on windows is installed as a virtual machine with virtualbox as the supporting virtualization container.

VT-x support is required because the virtual machine installed is a 64 bit guest and will not work if it's not available.

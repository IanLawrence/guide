# Highlighted Fields

A RapidFTR system administrator has the capability of defining a list of fields that are used in displaying summary information of child and enquiry records on the web and mobile device. This is done by selecting a few descriptive fields from within the list of form sections.

Highlighted fields are also used while searching for basic information on a child or enquiry.
